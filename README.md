## üîß AI Models & Algorithms

### Credit Scoring
- **Method**: Business rule-based scoring (hackathon speed)
- **Factors**: Income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history, employment
- **Range**: 300-850 (standard FICO-like scale)
- **Decision**: Automated approval thresholds

### Fraud Detection
- **Method**: Isolation Forest + business rules
- **Features**: Transaction amount, time, location risk, merchant risk
- **Threshold**: >70% probability triggers alert
- **Response**: Real-time blocking and blockchain logging

### Investment Advice
- **Technical Indicators**: 7-day MA, RSI (14-day)
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)
- **Signals**: RSI <30 (oversold/buy), RSI >70 (overbought/sell)
- **Recommendations**: STRONG BUY, BUY, HOLD, SELL, STRONG SELL

### Compliance Engine
- **AML Rules**: High-value transaction flags (>‚Çπ10L)
- **KYC Validation**: Completion status checks
- **Risk Assessment**: Scoring based on violation severity
- **Actions**: Automated recommendations for compliance teams

### NLP Chatbot
- **Intent Detection**: Regex-based pattern matching (production would use transformers)
- **Intents**: Loan status, credit score, investment advice, fraud reporting
- **Context**: Session-based conversation memory
- **Logging**: All interactions hashed to blockchain

## üè¶ Blockchain Implementation

### Simple Proof-of-Concept Chain
- **Consensus**: Proof of Work (difficulty: 2)
- **Block Structure**: Index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, nonce
- **Mining**: Automatic for demo (real system would have network)
- **Validation**: Full chain integrity checking

### Transaction Types
- `LOAN_DECISION`: Credit approval/rejection with reasoning
- `FRAUD_ALERT`: Suspicious activity detection
- `COMPLIANCE_ALERT`: AML/KYC violations
- `CHAT_LOG`: Hashed conversation records (privacy-preserving)

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"test123","income":500000,"loan_amount":200000,"credit_history_score":7,"employment_years":5,"existing_debts":50000,"purpose":"home"}'
```

### Frontend Testing
