## Judge Q&A - Prepared Answers

**Q: How does this scale to millions of users?**
A: "Current demo runs single-instance. Production would use Docker containers, Redis caching, database clustering, and microservices architecture. Blockchain would be Hyperledger Fabric for enterprise scale."

**Q: How accurate is the AI?**
A: "Demo uses business rules for speed. Production would train on real financial data with 95%+ accuracy. Models would be continuously retrained with new data."

**Q: What about regulatory compliance?**
A: "Platform includes AML/KYC automation, audit trails, and blockchain immutability. All AI decisions are explainable and logged for regulatory review."

**Q: How secure is the blockchain?**
A: "Demo uses proof-of-work consensus. Production would use permissioned blockchain like Hyperledger with identity management and enhanced privacy."

**Q: Real-time performance?**
A: "All AI decisions complete in <500ms. Market data updates every 30 seconds. Blockchain mining happens automatically in background."
